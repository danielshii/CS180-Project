## Project Overview
For our project, we decided to go with option one and make a social media posting application. This application includes the ability to create users and sign in to a specific user. The user can then create a post or comment on a post, and all of the posts from a specific user can be accessed. The user can also delete posts and comments, and the application is fully interactive, using a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the user. On top of this, data is saved for users, and testing is done to ensure that the program never crashes and can handle anything the user may throw at it.
